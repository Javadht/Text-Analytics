Accordint to the results, because there is the word "bad" in good similar words and vice versa, we can conclude it is not the case.
The reason behind this is that vectorization of word, can not understand quality of the word itself. it just considers probabilities of the happening words.
Another issue is that word bad, can be used both in negative sentiment and positive sentiment. Therefor, we barely can judge without other words in the sentence.
